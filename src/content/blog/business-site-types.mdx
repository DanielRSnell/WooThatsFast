When Lisa approached us about optimizing her online course platform, she had a common misconception: "I thought performance optimization was just for e-commerce sites." Her platform was taking 4-5 seconds to load, and student engagement was suffering. After optimization, with load times under 800ms, course completion rates increased by 35%. Her story illustrates an important truth: every type of business website needs performance optimization, just for different reasons.

Let's explore the various types of business websites we optimize and why performance matters for each:
