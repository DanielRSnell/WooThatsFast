When Maria's e-commerce team faced a critical decision about scaling their infrastructure, they weren't just looking for technical advice – they needed a partner who understood their business. "Our previous support provider just fixed tickets," she explains. "What we really needed was someone who could help us make better decisions." Her experience highlights a crucial truth: in today's digital landscape, your care plan partner can make or break your long-term success.
