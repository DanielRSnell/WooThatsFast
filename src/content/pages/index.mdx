faq:
  - question: "What performance improvements can I expect?"
    answer: "Our optimizations typically result in: 90+ Core Web Vitals scores, sub-2-second load times, 95+ Google PageSpeed scores, and up to 300% faster overall performance. All improvements are backed by our performance guarantee."
  
  - question: "What's included in the Core Web Vitals guarantee?"
    answer: "We guarantee your store will achieve passing scores in all Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS) as measured by Google. If these targets aren't met within 90 days, we'll continue optimizing at no additional cost until they are achieved."
